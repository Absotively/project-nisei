                    <p>This policy is a "living" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future. <b>Last updated October 2018.</b></p>
                    <hr />
                    <h2>Scope</h2>
                    <p>This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in other spaces involving the community. These include the Project NISEI Slack & Stimhack.com, its Twitter community, private email communications in the context of the community, and any events where members of the community are participating, as well as adjacent communities and venues affecting the community’s members.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the violation, the admins may decide that violations of this Code of Conduct beyond the scope of the community may deem an individual unwelcome, and admins reserve the right to take appropriate action to maintain the comfort and safety of its members.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h2>Our Pledge</h2>
                    <p>Project NISEl is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of belief, body size, disability (learning, mental, physical or any other kind), gender identity and expression, health conditions (mental or physical), physical appearance, race, religion or sexual orientation.  We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h2>Our Standards</h2>
                    <p>Examples of behaviour that helps to create a positive environment include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language.</li>
                        <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.</li>
                        <li>Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.</li>
                        <li>Focusing on what is best for the community.</li>
                        <li>Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances, including when simulated online. The only exception to sexual topics is channels/spaces specifically for topics of sexual identity.</li>
                        <li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, casual use of slurs or similar pejorative language, and personal or political attacks.</li>
                        <li>Making light of/making mocking comments about trigger warnings and content warnings.</li>
                        <li>Attacking someone’s use of cards/playstyles/strategies.</li>
                        <li>Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.</li>
                        <li>Physical contact without consent.</li>
                        <li>ublishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of “outing” of any aspect of someone’s identity without their explicit consent.</li>
                        <li>Publishing screenshots or quotes, especially from private channels, without all quoted users’ explicit consent.</li>
                        <li>Unsolicited explanations under the assumption that someone doesn’t already know it. Ask before you teach! Don’t assume what people’s knowledge gaps are. For example, someone is browsing sleeves. Don’t go up to them and tell them everything you know about sleeves. If someone needs to know the difference between Ultra Pro and Dragon Shield, they will ask.</li>
                        <li>Deliberately using incorrect pronouns for a person, especially after being informed of the correct ones. If you’re unsure, use gender-neutral language.</li>
                        <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.</li>
                        <li>Any attempt to present “reverse-ism” versions of the above as violations. Examples of reverse-isms are “reverse racism”, “reverse sexism”, “heterophobia”, and “cisphobia”. For example, if someone holds an event for women and non-binary players, we will not tolerate people saying it is unfair due to “reverse sexism”/”sexist to men/cis people”.</li>
                        <li>Any of the above even when presented as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism" target="blank">“ironic” or “joking”</a>.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <p>Players are attracted to Android: Netrunner for a number of different, often personal, reasons and therefore have different goals for the game and ways of working towards those goals. While some players will prefer a highly competitive style, others are interested primarily in the flavour and narrative of the Android universe. Likewise, players will be of a variety of skill levels, and so may have different interests or needs from the more seasoned players. Please respect all interests and play levels. Do not discourage or insult players who ask what may appear to you to be an obvious question. Do not dismiss or demean players who are more interested in the game's mechanics than its theming. All modes of engaging with Android: Netrunner are valid and should be respected.</p>

                    <h2>If Something Happens</h2>
                    <p>If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>If you can and feel safe doing so, let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s).</li>
                        <li>That person should immediately stop the behaviour and correct the issue.</li>
                        <li>If this doesn’t happen, or if you’re uncomfortable speaking up, contact admins.</li>
                        <li>As soon as available, an admin will join, identify themselves, and take further action, starting with a warning, then temporary deactivation, then long-term deactivation.</li>
                     </ol>
                    <p>When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Admin team will prioritize the well-being and comfort of the recipients of the violation over the comfort of the violator.</strong></p>
